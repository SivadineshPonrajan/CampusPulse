chmod +x ~/.config/autostart/campuspulse.desktop
```

### 6. Reboot the system

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Voilaaa... You are done! 🎉

## 🛠️ Working

- `main.py` is the main file that downloads the folders from SharePoint and displays.
- The files to be displayed should be in the form of images as `jpg/jpeg/png` or `PDF`.
- Scrapes the events from the public HH calendar and creates an image.
- Creates a combination of images and starts the slideshow.
- Every 12 hours, it redownloads the new files and scrapes the calendar.
- The script will automatically start running on system start or reboot.

**MAKE SURE THE RPI IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET!!!**

If something goes wrong or an error occurs, just reboot or restart.
